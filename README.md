# Belief Propagation

This repository contains the code for a project on belief propagation as part of the course "Graphical Models: Discrete Inference and Learning" (master MVA).

There are two main experiments:
- [Bayesian networks](blob/main/bayesian_network/bayesian_networks.ipynb)
- [Taxonomy induction](blob/main/factor_graph/taxonomy_induction.ipynb) using factor graphs

The slides of the project presentation are available [here](blob/main/presentation_slides.pdf).
