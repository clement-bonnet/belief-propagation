# Belief Propagation

This repository contains the code for a project on belief propagation as part of the course "Graphical Models: Discrete Inference and Learning" (master MVA).

There are two main experiments:
- [Bayesian networks](bayesian_network/bayesian_networks.ipynb) (wet grass example)
- [Factor graphs](factor_graph/taxonomy_induction.ipynb) (taxonomy induction)

The slides of the project presentation are available [here](presentation_slides.pdf).
